Hello and welcome to uberfavoritos!

This is a small little web app that allows you to add favorite locations!

Tech involved:
- Rack
- Sinatra
- Sequel
- Postgres
- Backbone.js
- Underscore.js
- Google Maps API
- (Twitter) Bootstrap)

Assumptions:
1) Single user with no user authentication/authorization

2) The concept of a 'favorite' is abstract in the sense that
some _thing_ has to be favorited. In this exercise, it is a favorite
location. I chose not to expound/elaborate upon this and keep it simple
by assuming that the only favorited item will be a location. Had I not
I probably would have gone with a different URL structure and database
schema.

3) I did not introduce environment-based configuration (e.g. development vs production)

4) Used integer based migrations numbers instead of timestamp

5) Denormalization of data to display favorites
Went with normalization of data to display abstraction of concepts

6) Would have chosen to go with sprockets or similar for my assets
7) Tests that rely on DB
