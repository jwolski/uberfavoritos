Assumptions:
1) Single user with no user authentication/authorization

2) The concept of a 'favorite' is abstract in the sense that
some _thing_ has to be favorited. In this exercise, it is a favorite
location. I chose not to expound/elaborate upon this and keep it simple
by assuming that the only favorited item will be a location. Had I not
I probably would have gone with a different URL structure and database
schema.

3) I did not introduce environment-based configuration (e.g. development vs production)

4) Used integer based migrations numbers instead of timestamp

5) Denormalization of data to display favorites
Went with normalization of data to display abstraction of concepts

TODO:
DONE 1) Get database config into config file
DONE 2) Create local postgres database
DONE 3) Define database migration for favorites table (Sequel)
DONE 4) Create rake task that runs migrations in heroku
DONE 5) Create Sequel model for Favorite
6) Add to favorites endpoint GET and POST
7) See if there's a better way to do idiomatic Sinatra database config (e.g. database.yml... Look at how ideeli did it with DAM)
8) 404 pages
9) Get connection string out of database.rb and put into maybe database.yml for Rakefile to share
10) correct doctype header for haml in views
11) make sure it works cross-browser
12) split views into partials

Questions
1) User management?
2) What does 'new' do in js?
